# Bloomberg Codecon JSConf 2014

My entries to the [Codecon](codecon.bloomberg.com) competition hosted by Bloomberg. 

# Description

You can follow the above link to find the descriptions of the problems, but in brief:

  * Find which one of 5 colors isn't in the list [colors.js](./colors.js)
  * Find which sum is most likely given randomly selected numbers from lists [giga.js](./giga.js)
  * Find the smallest palindrome that can be constructed from a sequence [paly.js](./paly.js)
  * Find the next number in the 'say' sequence [oneOne.js](./oneOne.txt)

You can run each with the sample input:
```
node colors.js colors.txt
...
```
# Results

Also: reading from process.stdin is a #*$(&$.
